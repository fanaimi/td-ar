I'm using the npm package "http-server" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to set up a simple webserver, but I cannot get it to use SSL. My command in package.json is

http-server -p 8000 -o -S
with a cert.pem and key.pem in my root directory (for now). The "-o" option opens a browser to the default page, but the page is served using HTTP and not even accessible through HTTPS. I don't get any errors or warnings. I've also tried adding the "-C" and "-K" options without luck. Has any one had any success with this package?

node.js ssl npm httpserver

First, make sure that you have key.pem and cert.pem files. You can generate them using this command:

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
This generates a cert-key pair and it will be valid for roughly 10 years (3650 days to be exact).

Then you need to run the server with -S for enabling SSL and -C for your certificate file:

$ http-server -S -C cert.pem -o
Starting up http-server, serving ./ through https
Available on:
  https:127.0.0.1:8080
  https:192.168.1.101:8080
  https:192.168.1.104:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server

It appears my package just needed an update. After trying everything, I saw I was running an old version... – delucasvb Feb 8 '16 at 7:33
How can I get this to use the same key and pem files from my local machine regardless of which app or sample code I'm running? – Costa Jan 25 '17 at 23:04

BTW if you ever need a certificate from a CA I recommend using letsencrypt.org. It solved our issues here. Cheers! – pinkfloyd Aug 23 '17 at 21:02

With Chrome 66 I have to enable Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost in chrome://flags as it says its untrusted – Neil Apr 30 '18 at 19:25

Just for future reference, my problem was solved by updating the package to the latest version in package.json. I copy-pasted an old example file without updating the version numbers.
